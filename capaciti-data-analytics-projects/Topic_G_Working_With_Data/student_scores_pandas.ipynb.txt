Student Scores Statistics Analysis

I'll analyze the dataset and answer each question using Python and Pandas.

import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Load the dataset

df = pd.read_csv('student_scores_statistics.csv')

import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Load the dataset df = pd.read_csv('student_scores_statistics.csv') # Question 1: Calculate and display the mean (average) score for all students mean_score = df['Score'].mean() print(f"1. Mean score for all students: {mean_score:.2f}\n") # Question 2: Identify and print the highest score and the student who achieved it max_score = df['Score'].max() top_student = df[df['Score'] == max_score][['Name', 'Score']] print("2. Highest score and student:") print(top_student.to_string(index=False)) print() # Question 3: Count the total number of students in the dataset total_students = df['Student_ID'].nunique() print(f"3. Total number of students: {total_students}\n") # Question 4: Group students by Subject and calculate mean score per subject subject_means = df.groupby('Subject')['Score'].mean() print("4. Mean score per subject:") print(subject_means.to_string()) print() # Question 5: Visualize the distribution of scores plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

plt.hist(df['Score'], bins=20, edgecolor='black', color='skyblue') plt.title('Distribution of Student Scores') plt.xlabel('Score') plt.ylabel('Number of Students') plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.5) plt.show() # Question 6: Identify students who scored below average and suggest improvement below_avg = df[df['Score'] < mean_score][['Name', 'Score']] print("\n6. Students who scored below average:") print(below_avg.to_string(index=False)) print("\nSuggested improvement: Implement peer tutoring programs where high-performing students mentor those struggling, focusing on subject-specific challenges.")

Results:

• Mean score for all students: 69.39

• Highest score and student:

• Total number of students: 100

• Mean score per subject:

Subject Computer Science 68.00 English 62.35 History 72.17 Mathematics 74.00 Science 66.76

• Visualization: The histogram shows a roughly normal distribution of scores, with most students scoring between 50 and 90.

• Students below average (first 5 shown):

(Total of 55 students scored below the average)

Suggested improvement: Implement peer tutoring programs where high-performing students mentor those struggling, focusing on subject-specific challenges.

The analysis reveals that Mathematics has the highest average score (74.00) while English has the lowest (62.35). About 55% of students scored below the overall average, suggesting targeted interventions could be beneficial.
